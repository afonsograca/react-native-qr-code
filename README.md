```

or

```
yarn add react-native-qrcode-composer
```

### Peer Dependencies
`React Native QR Code Composer` is designed to work seamlessly within the React Native ecosystem. However, it relies on several peer dependencies that need to be installed in your project. Ensure you have the following packages installed:

- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native)
- [React Native SVG ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-svg)

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the library:

```typescript
import QRCode from 'react-native-qrcode-composer';
import Logo from 'assets/logo.svg';
import logo from 'assets/logo.png';

// ...

// Basic QR Code Example
<QRCode value="https://github.com/afonsograca/react-native-qrcode-composer" />

// Advanced Usage with SVG and PNG logos
<QRCode value="QR code with SVG logo" logo={Logo} />
<QRCode value="QR code with PNG logo" logo={logo} />
```

## Props

The `react-native-qrcode-composer` library provides several props that you can use to customize the QR code and its appearance. These props allow you to specify the content of the QR code, its size, and the logo that appears in the center of the QR code, among other things. You can also specify a function that is called when an error occurs.
